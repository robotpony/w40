I was looking at buying a set of PFEIL carving tools this year, but was holding off as they're pretty pricy. I expanded my search a bit and found a similar set from a local Canadian company, Lee Valley Tools. They're hardened steel with a comfortable wooden handle. They sharpen easily (and keep their edge well), and feel like they will last a lifetime. They're also â…“ the price of the PFEIL tools.
