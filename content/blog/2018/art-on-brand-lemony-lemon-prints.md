Occasionally I like to sketch and carve things around our [lemony brand](https://lemonstand.com). It's fun to think sideways around our
polished brand marks, dreaming in colour and texture. These prints don't represent anything we would ever use, but the exercise was a
good stretch for me (and good practice).

This is a second print of the plate with an attempt at layering a textural plate over top. I still need to work on this technique,
but I do like the extra texture it adds to a print.
