I set up a new dev laptop for myself over the Christmas holidays. I took the opportunity to burn down my old environment and to survey the 2021 tool landscape, which included testing out various terminals and setups, editors, and fonts. This year I discovered [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), a tidy little monospace font that supports ligatures.

Ligatures are two or more letters (or graphemes) that can be combined to make a single glyph. The result of combining letters into these ligatures can make complex syntax a bit easier to read, especially if you are familiar with the notations the concepts are based on.

Fira Code has [installation instructions](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing) for most platforms, though be aware that most editors have additional requirements to enable the automatic display of ligatures.
