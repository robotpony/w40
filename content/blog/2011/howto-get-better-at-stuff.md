If you want to get better at something, do a lot of it. Throw yourself at practice and real chances to do it.

When you want to become great at something, stick with it, obsess over it, and suck up all of the knowledge that surrounds it.

And when you want to become truly incredible at something, you need to invert your thinking: reflect on the fundamentals, write, and do anything that lets you define what that thing is.

Then lather, rinse, and repeat.
