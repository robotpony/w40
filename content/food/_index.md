title: Food is good.
---

I like to cook. I like to eat. It's a grand arrangement.

The way I cook is somewhere between self-taught, faint memories of working in kitchens, and obsessively watching cooking shows on Youtube.

I also keep a [food diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kJQD1oO2rTovdkK9rq8FGdhJgK1_HLLwp7STzq-aafE/edit?tab=t.0), which I use
like an engineering and learning log. I use it to plan out menus, track techniques and cuisines I want to learn more about, and to tweak
recipes I'm developing.
