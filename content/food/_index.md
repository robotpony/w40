title: Food is good.
---

I like to cook. I like to eat. It's a grand arrangement.

I am a self-taught cook, with faint memories of working in kitchens, and an unhealthy obsession with cooking shows on Youtube (and a few on FoodTV).

I keep a [food diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kJQD1oO2rTovdkK9rq8FGdhJgK1_HLLwp7STzq-aafE/edit?tab=t.0), which I use like an engineering and learning log. I plan out menus, track techniques and cuisines I want to learn more about, and to tweak recipes I'm developing.
