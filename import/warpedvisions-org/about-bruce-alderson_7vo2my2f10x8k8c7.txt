# About me

Hi, I'm Bruce Alderson.

I design and craft software for fun and profit. I also write and make artful things using various methods and tools.

I enjoy life in all of its oddness and beauty, especially the distinct, the curious, and the wondrous. I believe that simplicity is possible in anything, where simple is defined as when things fit _just so_. I subscribe to the belief that who we are is had inch by inch, failure by failure.

Here are some of the things I've:
