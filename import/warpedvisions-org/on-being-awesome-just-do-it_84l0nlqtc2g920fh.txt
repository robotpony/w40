# On being awesome: just do it

[Merlin Mann](http://www.43folders.com/2011/01/17/permission-to-be-awesome) asks us why we're waiting to be awesome, as he remembers Steve Job's [2005 Stanford address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc). It's a good question: why do we wait?

There are all sorts of reasons, of course, but in the end my simple philosophy is: <em>just fucking do it</em>. Sometimes I have to say it to myself out loud, in the voice of [the Dude](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f5hvt/what_do_so_many_people_find_enjoyable_in_the_big/?limit=500), when things like absurd politics or chunky technical problems get in my way. "Just do it, man." I need to be reminded to carry on.

It isn't just doing what you love, you also have to choose to love what you do. Love the hard parts, get off on doing them. There will always be bullshit around what you love, if you choose to see it. Instead, let the noise melt away and get good at your craft. And then do it. Lots of it!

Don't wait. Don't see the bullshit. Don't even worry about the hard shit, it's the hard bits that really hone your craft. Work through it, do it well, and be proud of what you do. And over everything else, don't wait for a reason to do it. Be awesome.
