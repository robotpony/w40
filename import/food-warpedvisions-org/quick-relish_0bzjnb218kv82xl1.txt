# Quick relish

Today I wanted a relish for a dish so I made some:

- ½ cup of chopped, sweet pickles
- ½ cup of chopped, pickled peppers (mild - medium)
- ½ cup frozen corn, diced, and fried (until edges are brown and crispy)
- ¼ cup diced onions (purple is what I had on hand)
- ½ cup of mustard
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 1 tbsp freeze dried dill (if it’s out of seasons)
- Salt, pepper to taste

Combine, adjust seasoning, and rest in the refrigerator for a few hours.
